        I am a front-end developer from a non-traditional background. Accessibility is what drives me, and collaborative teamwork is what keeps me coming back. I bring with me over a decade of experience leading and working in cross-functional teams, using data to inform creative solutions to common problems, and connecting humans and technology in meaningful ways.

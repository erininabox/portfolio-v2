        <p>I love working with CSS and React, and am a highly visual person. I am interested in accessibility and security, and user engagement.</p>
        <p>With over a decade working in secondary and higher education, and another half decade in public mental health, I bring with me a well-honed sense of empathy and a strong history of using data and research to inform key decisions. These experiences have given me a great opportunity to see how people of all ages, education levels, linguistic ability, and socioeconomic backgrounds interact with the world around them--including technology. </p>
        <p>Because of the nature of this type of work, I am well-accustomed to working in cross-functional teams with distinct roles in a complex system with lots of ambiguity and quickly-changing priorities. To see some examples of this type of work, take at look at my portfolio!</p>
        <p>Here are some of the technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
        <ul className='about-tech-lists'>
            <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>Next.js</li>
            <li>WordPress</li>
            <li>Sass</li>
            <li>Tailwind</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

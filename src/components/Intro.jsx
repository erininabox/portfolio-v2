            Hi! <i className="fa-solid fa-mug-hot icon__para"></i> I'm  Erin Halden,
        </h2>
        <p>I am a front-end web developer located in the Bay Area.</p>
        <p>I love working with CSS and React, and am a highly visual person. I am interested in accessibility and security, and user engagement.</p>
        <p>With over a decade working in secondary and higher education, and another half decade in public mental health, I bring with me a well-honed sense of empathy and a strong history of using data and research to inform key decisions. These experiences have given me a great opportunity to see how people of all ages, education levels, linguistic ability, and socioeconomic backgrounds interact with the world around them--including technology. </p>
        <p>Because of the nature of this type of work, I am well-accustomed to working in cross-functional teams with distinct roles in a complex system with lots of ambiguity and quickly-changing priorities. To see some examples of this type of work, take at look at my portfolio!</p>
